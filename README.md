## Testing and Validation

### Testing finds

The site was tested on various screen sizes throughtout the creation process, the main issues found were with text spacing, which was fixed through the use of bootstrap margin and border classes. 

Additionally, bootstrap column classes were set up differently depending on the screen sizing, in order to increase readability on smaller devices. As a part of this, the tree image was resized and reshaped, so that it wouldn't take up the whole screen on smaller devices.
